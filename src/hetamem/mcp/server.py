    """Ingest text (and optional media captions) into the long-term knowledge-base memory.

    The input is processed through a multi-modal pipeline: text is passed directly;
    any attached video, audio, or image is transcribed/captioned first, then merged
    with the text before being fed into LightRAG. LightRAG extracts entities and
    relations, builds a knowledge graph, and stores semantic chunks in a vector index.
    Subsequent queries over the same KB will be able to reason across all inserted content.

    Use this tool to accumulate knowledge that should persist across sessions and be
    available for structured reasoning — documents, reports, domain knowledge, meeting
    notes, etc. For storing conversational facts about a specific user or agent, use
    vg_add instead.

    REQUIRED:
        query (str): The text content to store. Can be a sentence, paragraph, or
                     multi-page document. There is no length limit enforced at this
                     layer, but very large inputs will take longer to process.

    ⚠️  ASYNC — this tool returns immediately with status "accepted".
    The actual insertion (LightRAG entity extraction + graph construction)
    runs in the background and takes 10–60 seconds depending on text length
    and LLM latency.  Do NOT call kb_query right away — wait at least 30
    seconds after kb_insert before querying to ensure the content is indexed.

    RETURNS (202 Accepted):
        {"id": "<uuid>", "query": "<original text>", "status": "accepted", ...}

    EXAMPLE — store a domain knowledge document:
        kb_insert(query="Transformer models use self-attention to capture long-range \
dependencies without recurrence, making them highly parallelisable during training.")

    Retrieves relevant content from the LightRAG knowledge graph and vector index,
    then synthesises a final answer using the configured LLM. The retrieval strategy
    is controlled by the mode parameter. Optionally, a parametric memory model (a
    fine-tuned LLM that has internalised domain knowledge) can be consulted first;
    if its answer is judged relevant it is used directly, bypassing RAG retrieval.

    Use this tool when you need to answer questions that require reasoning over
    structured, persistent knowledge — content previously ingested via kb_insert.

    REQUIRED:
        query (str): The question or information need, expressed in natural language.

    OPTIONAL:
        mode (str): Retrieval strategy. Choose based on the nature of the question:
            - "local"  — retrieves from the immediate neighbourhood of matched entities
                         in the knowledge graph. Best for specific, entity-focused questions.
            - "global" — aggregates high-level community summaries across the full graph.
                         Best for broad thematic or comparative questions.
            - "hybrid" — combines local and global retrieval (default). Best general-purpose
                         choice when the question scope is unknown.
            - "naive"  — plain vector similarity search without graph traversal. Fastest
                         but misses multi-hop relational reasoning.
        use_pm (bool): If True, queries the parametric memory model before attempting RAG.
                       If the model's answer is deemed relevant, it is returned directly
                       without touching the knowledge graph. Default is False.
