## What is Heta?

Heta is an all-in-one knowledge infrastructure for AI agents. It integrates multiple underlying databases to help agents do three things: acquire external knowledge, accumulate their own memory, and reason and generate based on that knowledge.

- **HetaDB** — Unified management across multiple databases for smarter external knowledge integration. No need to worry about what format the knowledge comes from or which database it should go into.
- **HetaMem** — Dual-mode memory: fast episodic recall via vector search (MemoryVG), and a long-term knowledge graph that evolves continuously with the agent (MemoryKB).
- **HetaGen** — Synthesizes and expands upon existing knowledge bases to generate higher-value structured content.

## Key Features

**HetaDB**

- Multi-format file parsing via MinerU and other tools (PDF, HTML, images, sheets, Markdown, Office file formats, archives, etc.)
- Parsed knowledge is automatically distributed across the appropriate databases — no manual storage decisions required
- Multiple query strategies for different scenarios: `naive` (vector search)， `rerank` (BM25 + vector + cross-encoder)， `rewriter` (query pptimization)， `multihop` (ReAct)， `direct` (direct query)
- Source document tracing to support agentic search workflows

**HetaMem**

- **MemoryVG** — Lightweight memory for high-frequency, fragmented information: quickly stores and retrieves conversation content, user preferences, and contextual facts; full CRUD + history audit
- **MemoryKB** — Empowers AI agents with continuous, multimodal memory by combining hierarchical knowledge graphs with fast parametric recall, enabling long-term context understanding and personalized, adaptive interactions.

**HetaGen** _(early stage)_

- Generates structured tabular data from knowledge bases and supports Text-to-SQL queries on the generated tables
- Automatically construct hierarchical knowledge structures (tag trees) from topics

!!! tip "MCP Integration"
HetaDB and HetaMem expose optional MCP servers (ports 8012 / 8011) for direct integration with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible clients.
